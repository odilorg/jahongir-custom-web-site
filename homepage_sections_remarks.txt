REMARKS – HOMEPAGE SECTIONS (Trending Activities, Popular Tours, Top Places, Traveller Reviews)
Role: Oversight notes for AI coder (Laravel + Filament v4). Dev executes the changes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOP PRIORITIES (FIX NOW)
1) Trending Activities: Remove duplicated “watermark” headings that overlay titles.
   - If created via ::after pseudo-element, disable or keep behind overlay.
     CSS:
       .activity-card::after { content: none; }  /* or keep but ensure layering */
       .activity-card__content { position: relative; z-index: 2; }
       .activity-card__overlay { z-index: 1; }
2) Badge contrast (cards): Ensure white count pill maintains ≥4.5:1 contrast on gradients.
   - CSS:
       .activity-card__badge { background: rgba(255,255,255,.92); border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.06); }
3) Currency formatting: Use consistent thousands separators across Popular Tours (e.g., $890 → $890, $1,290 → $1,290).
4) JSON-LD on list pages:
   - For TouristTrip items, include "url" in each Offer, use numeric "price", keep organization/provider consistent.
   - Remove third‑party Review schema (TripAdvisor) from the Reviews section to comply with Google guidelines (only mark up first‑party reviews hosted on our domain). Keep the visible content and badge.

TRENDING ACTIVITIES (Grid)
- Keep hybrid card (photo + gradient + icon + title + description + CTA + count).
- Cards must be single clickable anchors with aria-labels.
- Image handling: object-fit: cover; aspect-ratio: 16/10; explicit width/height.
- Hover/focus: translateY(-3px) and stronger shadow (≤250ms). Ensure :focus-visible outline on entire card.
- Dynamic order: sort by tours_count DESC (backend).
- Count pill: top-right; semi-transparent or frosted glass effect.
- Performance: add srcset/sizes, lazy-load all but first 1–2 visible cards.

EXPLORE POPULAR TOURS (Cards)
- Add srcset/sizes to all images; lazy-load all but first visible card.
- Offers: numeric price, priceCurrency "USD", availability InStock, add offer url.
- Ratings: aria-label="Rated X out of 5". Do not add Review/Rating schema to list page unless eligible.
- Consistent casing (e.g., “Charvak Lake” vs “Charvak”). Pick one style and keep it.

TOP PLACES TO TRAVEL (Destinations)
- Verify geo coordinates for each city (Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, Tashkent).
- If “X tours available” is not dynamic, remove or switch to “Popular destination” to avoid stale data.
- Mobile: ensure text does not push CTA off-screen; truncate long lines if necessary.

TRAVELLER REVIEWS
- Keep visible testimonials and TripAdvisor link/badge.
- Remove Review JSON-LD sourced from TripAdvisor (third‑party review markup on our domain is discouraged).
- If later collecting on-site reviews, then add first‑party Review/aggregateRating schema on the relevant page.

ACCESSIBILITY (Global)
- Section headings: H2; card titles: H3.
- Ensure keyboard focus is visible on:
  - activity cards, tour cards, city cards, buttons (ghost and primary).
- Alt text: keep descriptive and contextual (not file names).
- Color contrast: verify all foreground text over gradients meets WCAG AA (≥4.5:1).

PERFORMANCE
- Explicit width/height on all images (done). Add decoding="async" (done) and srcset/sizes (todo).
- Use WebP/AVIF where available; target ≤120 KB per image (≤80 KB ideal).
- Defer icon fonts or switch to inline SVG for the six activity icons to cut blocking time.
- Lighthouse target: CLS ≤ 0.05; LCP ≤ 2.5s on 3G/slow 4G.

SEO
- ItemList schema for Trending Activities is good—keep.
- TouristTrip ItemList is fine; prefer including "url" fields; prices numeric.
- Canonical URL: confirm final production domain before launch.
- Internal anchor text should be descriptive (“Explore Cultural Tours”) for the CTA spans.

QA CHECKLIST (MARK WHEN DONE)
[ ] Watermark text removed or layered correctly on all 6 activity cards.
[ ] Count pill contrast and border updated.
[ ] Currency formatting consistent across all tour cards.
[ ] TouristTrip schema validates (prices numeric, offer URLs present).
[ ] Third‑party Review schema removed; page validates without warnings.
[ ] Images use srcset/sizes and lazy‑loading strategy verified.
[ ] Focus-visible works on every interactive element.
[ ] Contrast over gradients passes WCAG AA.
[ ] Grid breaks 3→2→1 at 1200/768 px as expected.
[ ] Links route correctly; canonical verified.

NOTES FOR DEV (Laravel + Filament v4)
- Provide tours_count via Eloquent with withCount('tours'), sort DESC.
- Expose category icon class and image path via fields; ensure null-safe fallbacks (gradient-only card).
- Blade components: build <x-activity-card>, <x-tour-card>, <x-city-card> for reuse and consistent a11y.
- Centralize gradient, radius, shadow tokens to stay consistent with Section 2.
