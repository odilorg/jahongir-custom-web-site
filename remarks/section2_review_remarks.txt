📋 REVIEW REMARKS: SECTION 2 – WHY WE'RE YOUR PERFECT TRAVEL PARTNER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ OVERALL EVALUATION
Rating: ★★★★★ (4.9 / 5)

This section already follows modern UI/UX and SEO standards:
- 2-column layout with strong visual balance
- Human, trustworthy copy focused on “why choose us”
- Clear CTAs and contact channels
- Ready for responsive, semantic, and accessible implementation

🧩 STRENGTHS

✔ Structure & Clarity:
Your column grid and typography hierarchy are textbook perfect — “Eyebrow → Heading → Description → Benefits → Media.”

✔ Consistency:
Using CSS variables and the `.container` pattern keeps everything consistent with the rest of the site.

✔ Copywriting:
The tone is warm, personal, and distinctly Uzbek — it sells “authentic, local, trustworthy” very well.

✔ Technical Planning:
Performance, lazy-loading, focus states, and schema are all pre-planned — rare in most specs.

✏️ SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

1. VISUAL HIERARCHY
- Reduce benefit cards from 3 → 2 on mobile for easier scrolling.
- Combine “Local Expertise” + “24/7 Support” into one hybrid card on mobile.
- Add subtle divider (e.g., light gradient or top border) between copy block and benefit cards.

2. CONTENT ADJUSTMENTS
Replace the generic text:
“With over 10 years of experience guiding travelers through Uzbekistan’s ancient cities...”
→
“For over a decade, Jahongir Travel has been guiding guests beyond postcards — into the living heart of Uzbekistan’s culture, cuisine, and craftsmanship.”

Also, clarify in Benefit #3 that multilingual support includes English, French, Russian, and Uzbek.

3. RIGHT-COLUMN IMAGE GRID
- Add soft shadow to separate images from beige background.
- Use real data in badge: “4.9 ★ | 2,400+ Happy Travelers”.
- Optional: animate badge fade-in or pulse slightly on hover.

4. CTA PLACEMENT
Add one main CTA below benefits:
[Plan My Trip] → links to /contact/ or /tours/
(Helps convert readers who scroll without clicking contact info.)

5. SCHEMA MARKUP
Add JSON-LD under <section id="why-us">:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Jahongir Travel",
  "telephone": "+998 99 123 4567",
  "email": "info@jahongirtravel.com",
  "areaServed": "Uzbekistan",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": "2400"
  }
}

6. OPTIONAL UX ENHANCEMENTS
If using AOS (Animate on Scroll):
- Fade-right for text column
- Fade-up for image grid
- Delay 100–200ms for each benefit card for smooth reveal
