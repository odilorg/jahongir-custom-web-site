=====================================

Summary
-------

SEO & Technical (A-)
--------------------
✔ Canonical and OG tags correctly implemented.
✔ Title and meta description concise and descriptive.
✔ JSON-LD for FAQPage and BreadcrumbList correctly added.
⚠ Replace “TouristTrip” schema with “Tour” for improved Google interpretation.
⚠ Add `priceValidUntil` and ensure `aggregateRating` appears only when visible on page.
⚠ Add hreflang tags if multilingual pages exist.


Content & Information Architecture (B+)
---------------------------------------
✔ H1–H2–H3 hierarchy is consistent.
✔ Clear structure: Overview, Highlights, Included, Cancellation, FAQ.
⚠ Missing “Itinerary,” “Meeting Point & Pickup,” and “Know Before You Go” sections—important for completeness and user clarity.
⚠ Add internal links to related posts (/cities/samarkand/, /insights/Registan).


Accessibility & UX (B)
----------------------
✔ Buttons labeled and icons marked aria-hidden where decorative.
⚠ Mobile navigation toggle should update aria-expanded dynamically.
⚠ Maintain focus outlines for all interactive elements.

Performance & Core Web Vitals (B)
---------------------------------
✔ Images use width/height and WebP format.
⚠ Font Awesome adds ~90KB render-blocking resource.
⚠ Inline 10–14KB critical CSS and defer the rest.
⚠ Use `fetchpriority="high"` for hero; lazy-load all other images.
⚠ Replace FA icons with inline SVGs.
⚠ Compress and preload main CSS.


Conversion UX (A-)
------------------
✔ Booking card is well-structured with price breakdown and mobile sticky CTA.
⚠ Add trust badges (“Free cancellation,” “Secure payments,” “24/7 support”). 
⚠ Show “Instant confirmation” or “24h confirmation” near CTA for clarity.
✔ WhatsApp contact visible (great for conversions).


Internal Linking & Crawl Depth (B+)
-----------------------------------

⚠ Add descriptive internal anchors within body text (e.g., “Read about Registan Square in our Samarkand Guide”).

⚠ For Tour schema, ensure “offers” section includes:
   - price
   - priceCurrency
   - availability
   - priceValidUntil
⚠ Only include review markup if reviews appear visually.


Internationalization (C+)
-------------------------
