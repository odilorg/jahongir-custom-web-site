TOUR DETAILS PAGE PLAN — REVIEW REMARKS FOR AI CODER

GENERAL OVERVIEW
- Excellent overall structure and sequencing: clearly separated frontend, backend, and QA phases.
- Keep the document as the single source of truth for UI → data → schema mapping.

CONTENT FIXES
- Replace all mentions of “Yagoz” with “Jahongir Travel” for brand consistency.
- Correct inconsistent phone/WhatsApp numbers (use +998 format across sections).
- Align pricing: the booking box shows $50 while the breakdown lists $250 — unify price logic.

ACCESSIBILITY & SEMANTICS
- Add BreadcrumbList JSON-LD to complement visible breadcrumbs.
- Implement FAQPage schema for the FAQ section using existing <details>/<summary> structure.
- Ensure ARIA roles and keyboard navigation for gallery controls and booking form.

PERFORMANCE & UX
- Optimize image loading in galleries: lazy-load all except the first, define width/height to prevent layout shifts.
- Use prefers-reduced-motion for gallery transitions and animations.
- Add skeleton loaders for gallery and booking panel to maintain perceived performance.
- Keep the booking sidebar sticky only on desktop, and implement a floating CTA for mobile.

DATA & SCHEMA
- Add TouristTrip + Offer JSON-LD on the tour detail page.
- Include fields: includes/excludes, duration, languages, and availability in the schema.
- Mirror FAQ and breadcrumbs into schema markup.

CODE STRUCTURE
- Centralize price calculation logic in one JS function (`recalculate()`), called from guest/date change handlers.
- Store static JSON data for a tour inside a <script type="application/json" id="tour-data"> element for faster hydration.
- Prepare for currency and i18n formatting hooks early (don’t hardcode $).

EDGE CASE TESTS
- Gallery keyboard navigation (arrows, focus on thumbnails).
- Long tour titles wrapping gracefully on small screens.
- Sidebar overlap with footer on very short pages.
- FAQ toggle animations with multiple open items.

NEXT STEPS
1. Build Hero Gallery section (Section 2) with aspect-ratio boxes and lazy loading.
2. Implement Booking Sidebar (Section 10) — ensure brand, price sync, and responsive sticky/floating logic.
3. Add structured data: TouristTrip, Offer, BreadcrumbList, and FAQPage.
4. Verify accessibility and schema in Rich Results Test before backend integration.
