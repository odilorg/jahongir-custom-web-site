REMARKS FOR SECTION 3 — “Trending Activities in Uzbekistan”
Role: Product/UX oversight notes for AI coder (Laravel + Filament v4 backend)
----------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL
- Present 6–8 top tour categories as highly scannable, conversion‑oriented cards.
- Combine emotional photography with brand-consistent iconography.
- Drive clicks to category pages; surface real-time tour counts dynamically from database.

DECISION
- Use a HYBRID card layout: photo background + gradient overlay + category icon + title + 1-line description + CTA + count badge.
- Do NOT copy the reference 1:1. Keep spacing, corner radius, and shadows consistent with the Section 2 design system.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
- Header: H2 “Trending Activities in Uzbekistan”; subtitle “Choose your style of travel”.
- Grid Layout:
  • Desktop: 3 columns × 2 rows
  • Tablet: 2 columns × 3 rows
  • Mobile: 1 column stacked
- Each Card Includes:
  - Image (background with overlay)
  - Icon (category type)
  - Title (H3)
  - Short description (max 90 chars)
  - “Explore Tours →” CTA text
  - Count badge (e.g., “12 tours”)
- Entire card should be clickable (single anchor wrapper).

DATA SOURCE (Laravel + Filament)
- Use TourCategory model (or similar taxonomy entity).
- Pull data:
  - id, name, slug, image_path, icon_class, short_description, tours_count
- Sort categories by tours_count DESC.
- If count = 0, hide the category or display a “Coming soon” tag.
- Allow future expansion for featured flag or weight column.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Section heading level: H2; each card title: H3.
- Add aria-label on <a> for screen readers, e.g., aria-label="Explore Cultural & Historical tours".
- Maintain visible :focus outline for keyboard users.
- Ensure gradient + text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA).

VISUAL DESIGN SPECS
- Card container: border-radius 16–20px; box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.12).
- Background image: object-fit: cover; aspect-ratio: 16/10.
- Overlay: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0,0,0,0) 35%, rgba(0,0,0,.55) 100%).
- Title font-size: 1.25rem (desktop), 1.125rem (tablet).
- Count badge: top-right position; semi-transparent or frosted glass effect.
- Icon: 24–28px; accent color (#F4B400 or theme variable).
- Hover state: slight lift + stronger shadow; transition 0.25s ease.

PERFORMANCE
- Use responsive image sets with srcset + sizes.
- Lazy-load all except the first two visible images.
- Explicit width/height to avoid layout shifts.
- Compress and serve WebP/AVIF format under 120 KB each.
- Defer or inline icons as SVGs for better performance.

SEO
- Link each card to its category route (e.g., /tours/category/{slug}).
- Add JSON-LD ItemList schema for SEO enrichment (positions 1–6).
- Prioritize categories with most tours or engagement first.
- Use descriptive alt text including keywords like “Uzbekistan tour”, “Silk Road travel”, etc.

SCHEMA (drop-in JSON-LD example)
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",

    {"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Mountain & Adventure","url":"https://jahongirtravel.com/tours/category/adventure"}
  ]
}

RESPONSIVE RULES
- ≥1200px: 3-column layout with equal heights.
- 768–1199px: 2 columns, reduced padding and font sizes.
- <768px: 1 column, stacked cards, simplified gradient for performance.
- Maintain consistent gutter (24px desktop, 16px mobile).

QA / ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- [ ] Cards responsive and clickable as single link elements.
- [ ] Correct routes generated via Laravel route('tours.category', $slug).
- [ ] Images, icons, and titles load dynamically from DB.

- [ ] Hover/focus states consistent with brand style.
- [ ] Contrast and text readability pass accessibility tests.
- [ ] Section validated on all breakpoints (1440, 1024, 768, 480, 375).
- [ ] JSON-LD validated with Google Rich Results test.

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS
- Add a “View all tours →” link below grid to /tours.
- Add analytics tags (e.g., data-category) for tracking user engagement.
- Use intersection observer to trigger fade-in animation for cards.
- Optional “Featured” label if backend marks some categories as promoted.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPER
- Backend: Laravel + Filament v4.
- Model: TourCategory with relationship hasMany(Tour::class).
- Controller provides data to Blade or Inertia component.
- Use componentized BEM classes: .activities, .activities__grid, .activity-card, etc.
- Follow same color, typography, and spacing tokens as Section 2.
