## üöß Known Risks & Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Content Population Time**

### **Risk 2: Payment Gateway Complexity**
- **Risk:** Payment integration more complex than expected
- **Impact:** Delays Phase 3
- **Mitigation:** Start with "Request Quote" instead of direct payment, add payment later

### **Risk 3: Performance Issues**
- **Risk:** Site slow with real data
- **Impact:** Poor user experience
- **Mitigation:** Implement caching early, optimize database queries, use CDN

### **Risk 4: SEO Requirements**
- **Risk:** SSR conversion complex
